# Project 1

Write a program that shall collect information about the total area, GDP (PPP), length of roadways, and length of railways in the world, per country, based on the [CIA Worldfact Book](https://www.cia.gov/Library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/textversion.html).

The program shall start from the WFB main page (see URL above) and extract the URLs of all countries and territories, as well as their 2-letter codes. For each country and territory, the program shall download the fact page, from which extract the four parameters mentioned above. Each parameter shall be converted to a numeric value. If a parameter is missing (as it would be a case with any country without railways), the program shall set it to 0.

The program shall save the results into a CSV file called "cia.csv". The file shall have five columns: CountryCode, Area, GDP, Roads, Railways. The first row of the file shall have the column names. Each row of the file shall have a record pertaining to one country or territory.
