# Project 2

Write a program that shall calculate word sentiment level, based on the user reviews from the Yelp academic dataset.

The attached file has 156,602 reviews written by Yelp members (the original dataset has 1,569,265 reviews). Each review has a text fragment and a star rating on the scale from1 (worst) to 5 (best). We assume that the words predominantly used in "bad" reviews are "bad" and the words predominantly used in "good" reviews are "good." The measure of the sentiment level of a word, therefore, is the average star rating of all reviews where the word is used.
